# Al-Buraq Logistics — Static Website

This is a simple static website for Al-Buraq Logistics (cargo & freight delivery). Files are separated:
- HTML pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `vehicles.html` (shipments), `contact.html`, `booking.html` (request a quote)
- CSS: `css/styles.css`
- JS: `js/script.js`
- Assets: `assets/logo.svg`

Quick notes:
- The booking form in `booking.html` submits to `save_booking.php` (server-side PHP). Submitted bookings are stored in the `bookings` table in the local `alburaq` database.

Deploy:
- GitHub Pages: Push the folder to a repo and enable Pages in repo settings (branch `main` / `/docs` or root).
- Netlify: Drag & drop the folder into Netlify or connect the repo for continuous deploy.

Contact info used in the site:
- Owner: Sami Alhamdani
- Phone: +1 (475) 222-7511
- Email: samialir70@gmail.com

If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholder images with your real images
- Configure a server-side endpoint (e.g., `save_booking.php` + MySQL) and test submission
- Deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify and set up a custom domain

## Database & Admin (added)
- Database created: `alburaq`
- DB user created: `alburaq_user`@`localhost` with limited privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on `alburaq`.
  - Credentials saved in `config.php` (placed in project root). **Keep this file out of version control.**
- Admin interface added under `admin/`:
  - `admin/login.php` — login form
  - `admin/bookings.php` — list, delete, and export bookings (CSV)
  - `admin/logout.php` — logout
  - `admin/config.php` — admin username and hashed password. Default admin username: `admin` and a one-time autogenerated password was created (check the file for the plaintext password once). Please change it immediately.

**Next steps / recommendations:**
1. Change the admin password (`admin/config.php`) to something secure right away. Use `password_hash('yourpassword', PASSWORD_DEFAULT)` to generate the new hash.
2. `config.php` is now added to `.gitignore` and application logs are stored in `logs/app.log`. Keep `config.php` and `logs/` out of version control.
3. Optionally create a stronger DB user with more restricted rights or a production-ready access policy.

**Server/UX improvements added:**
- Server-side errors and DB exceptions are now logged to `logs/app.log` (no detailed DB errors shown to site visitors).
- The booking form now uses client-side validation and AJAX submission for better UX; server-side validation remains in place.
